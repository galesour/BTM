Trump agrees that the Pelosi Taiwan trip is about insider trading and pumping semiconductor stocks. Be wary!
Nancy Pelosi is willing to risk starting a war with China so that she can make massive profits on her husband's insider trading deals on computer chips.#Pelosi #Taiwan.
This place looks so much like the town from Spirited Away (Jiufen, Taiwan).
BREAKING: #Pelosi seen flying over #Taiwan. Stunning footage...
"We are about to takeoff, buy Puts on Taiwan Semiconductor"
Taiwan is 7,600 miles from the US. The US is in a recession. WTF are we doing sticking our nose in their business when it's none of our damn business and OUR PEOPLE have problems that need to be addressed?
Pelosi family got caught so they sold $5 in Nvidia semiconductor stock last week right before Congress is set to vote on semiconductor subsidies, now Pelosi flies to semiconductor world headquarters Taiwan to pump the stock
Liberals after hearing the word “Taiwan” for the first time
Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan is expected to cost tax payers over $90 million for security, allocation of US military presence, and more.
"Imagine if we lived in a insanely different world where everything was completely alterated" is really the best argument these people have to defend a Chinese invasion of Taiwan.

Football’s coming home!! It’s coming home!! IT’s coming!!
A full house at Wembley to watch the Women’s Euro final. It really is amazing to see the growth in the women’s game. Football is, more than ever, the global game.
This is why it matters. Representation. My daughter doesn’t have to have an interest in football. She just has to know that it’s an option. That she can become anything she sets her little heart on. From a princess to a lioness. And everything in between.
It’s just made me realise that I do not hate football or even find it boring, the problem all along was men
This is for my Great Grandma, who was banned from playing football 3 years after this picture was taken. Tears. Tears of joy.
Here’s @AlexScott reminding us all that 4 yrs ago when women’s football needed larger stadia, many clubs said NO. They know who they are!!
Loving Alex Scott and Ian Wright refusing to rosetint the history and the present conditions of women’s football in this country tbh
What a great tournament! Incredible advert for womens football and sport in general. Inspirational stuff. Congrats @Lionesses
Football is a simple game. 22 women chase a ball for 90 minutes and, at the end, England actually win. Congratulations @lionesses. Fabulous.
